\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let $X$ be the total medical expenses incurred by a particular individual during a given year. Although $X$ is a discrete random variable, suppose its distribution is quite well approximated by a continuous distribution with pdf $f(x) = k(1 + x/2.5)^{-7}$ for $x \geq 0$.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item What is the value of $k$? (2 points)
		\item Graph the pdf of $X$. (2 points)
		\item What are the expected value and standard deviation of total mediacal expenses? (4 points)
		\item 
		This individual is covered by an insurance plan that entails a \$500 deductible provision (so the first \$500 worth of expenses are paid by the individual). Then the plan will pay 80\% of any additional expenses exceeding \$500, and the maximum payment by the individual (including the deductible amount) is \$2500. Let $Y$ denote the amount of this individual's medical expenses paid by the insurance company. What is the expected value of $Y$? [Hint: First figure out what value of $X$ corresponds to the maximum out-of-pockect expenses of \$2500. Then write an expression for $Y$ as a function of $X$ (which involves several different pieces) and calculate the expected value of this function.] (4 points)
	\end{enumerate}

	\item 
	In a system with a large number of particles, the magnitude of velocity $X$ of these particles can be described by the Maxwell distritbuion, the pdf is given by
	\[f(x) = \begin{cases}
		 A x^2 e^{-x^2/b} & , x > 0\\
		 0 & , \mathrm{otherwise}
	\end{cases},\]
	where $b = m/(2kT)$. $k$ is the Bolzmann's constant, $T$ is the thermodynamic temperature, and $m$ is the particle mass. Suppose $b$ is known, express the constant $A$ in terms of $b$. (4 points)
